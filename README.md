# Prediction-Correction-Scheme-based-on-ADMM

We focus on a prediction-correction scheme based on  the augmented Lagrangian method (PCSALM) for solving the multi-block separable convex minimization model. 

By the special indefinite proximal term, this PCSALM simplify the subproblem as a proximal point problem, and thus the subproblem will be easy enough to have closed-form solutions for many applications. 

Furthermore, the proximal parameter can reach to the optimal lower bound 0.5 and is independent of the number of variables and the dual step-length, different from the existing methods.
